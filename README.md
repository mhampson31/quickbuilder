This is a very much in-progress Django app meant to help quickly set up games of X-Wing Second Edition using quick builds. A user can select a faction and threat level and get a completely random list meeting those criteria, with details of all the stats, abilities, and upgrades of each ship.

The project uses the json data from https://github.com/guidokessels/xwing-data2 as a starting point for all quick build, ship/pilot, and upgrade info, and the CSS-based icons from https://github.com/geordanr/xwing-miniatures-font.
